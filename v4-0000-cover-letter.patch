Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] iio: pressure: bmp280: GPIO error handling and cleanups

Hi all,

This patch series improves the GPIO error handling and addresses small
cleanups in the bmp280 driver.

Changes in v4:
  - Split patch 2/2 into two separate patches, as suggested by Markus
    Elfring.

Changes in v3:
  - Split into two separate patches, as suggested by Andy Shevchenko.
  - Improve the error message to "failed to get reset GPIO", as
    suggested by David Lechner.
  - Add Fixes and Cc tags where appropriate, as suggested by Markus
    Elfring.

Changes in v2:
  - Use IS_ERR() instead of IS_ERR_OR_NULL()
  - Drop dev_info()
  - Use gpiod_set_value_cansleep()
  - Improve commit title and message

Salah Triki (3):
  iio: pressure: bmp280: Use IS_ERR() in bmp280_common_probe()
  iio: pressure: bmp280: Remove noisy dev_info()
  iio: pressure: bmp280: Use gpiod_set_value_cansleep()
